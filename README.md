My hobbies are creating artworks such as Portraits or Anime Arts. I am huge fan of rock genre such as Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Stone Temple Pilots, The Smashing Pumpkins, and Audioslave. I also like other genres like metal, divorce dad rock and many more. My favorite quote is "I am a man, not a saint" from Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas.
